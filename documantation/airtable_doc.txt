Authentication
Basics
Airtable's API uses token-based authentication, allowing users to authenticate API requests by inputting their tokens into the HTTP authorization bearer token header.

Example:

curl https://api.airtable.com/v0/YOUR_BASE_ID/YOUR_TABLE_ID_OR_NAME -H \
"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
All API requests must be authenticated and made through HTTPS.

Passing personal access tokens and OAuth access tokens via the legacy api_key URL parameter is not supported.

Types of token
As of February 1st 2024, the deprecation period for Airtable API keys has ended. Users of Airtable API keys must migrate to the new authentication methods to continue using Airtable's API. See this article for more details.

We currently support using personal access tokens and OAuth access tokens during the authentication process.

Personal access tokens are for personal development, like building an integration for yourself, your client, or your company. They can be created and managed at /create/tokens or from the enterprise admin panel for service accounts. Personal access tokens act as your user account, and should not be shared with third-party services or integrations.

OAuth access tokens are recommended for building an integration where other users grant your service access to Airtable’s API on their behalf. In this case, your integration is a third-party service with respect to Airtable. After registering your integration with Airtable at /create/oauth, tokens are available via the OAuth grant flow.

Any integrations that allow other users to grant access to Airtable should use OAuth.

Scopes and resources/access
Personal access and Oauth tokens serve as the account of the user who grants access, with the following limitations:

Scopes: What actions the token can perform.
Resources/access: What bases and workspace the token can access. Tokens can be granted access to individual—or all—bases/workspaces. These can be listed using the list bases endpoint.
For example, to update a record in a base via API, the user who granted the token must have editor access to the base. Additionally, the token must have both the correct scope (data.records:write) and the base added to it as a resource.

For personal access tokens, scopes and resources/access are individually configured from /create/tokens. And for OAuth access tokens, developers choose the requested scopes from /create/oauth, while end-users decide what resources to grant access to.

List records
get
https://api.airtable.com/v0/{baseId}/{tableIdOrName}
List records in a table. Note that table names and table ids can be used interchangeably. We recommend using table IDs so you don't need to modify your API request when your table name changes.

The server returns one page of records at a time. Each page will contain pageSize records, which is 100 by default. If there are more records, the response will contain an offset. To fetch the next page of records, include offset in the next request's parameters. Pagination will stop when you've reached the end of your table. If the maxRecords parameter is passed, pagination will stop once you've reached this maximum.

Returned records do not include any fields with "empty" values, e.g. "", [], or false.

You can filter, sort, and format the results with query parameters. Note that these parameters need to be URL encoded. You can use our API URL encoder tool to help with this. If you are using a helper library like Airtable.js, these parameters will be automatically encoded.

Note Airtable's API only accepts request with a URL shorter than 16,000 characters. Encoded formulas may cause your requests to exceed this limit. To fix this issue you can instead make a POST request to /v0/{baseId}/{tableIdOrName}/listRecords while passing the parameters within the body of the request instead of the query parameters.

Base read-only

Billing plans	All plans
Path parameters
baseId
string
tableIdOrName
string
Query parameters
timeZone
optional<Timezone>
The time zone that should be used to format dates when using string as the cellFormat. This parameter is required when using string as the cellFormat.

userLocale
optional<string>
The user locale that should be used to format dates when using string as the cellFormat. This parameter is required when using string as the cellFormat.

pageSize
optional<number>
The number of records returned in each request. Must be less than or equal to 100. Default is 100.

maxRecords
optional<number>
The maximum total number of records that will be returned in your requests. If this value is larger than pageSize (which is 100 by default), you may have to load multiple pages to reach this total.

offset
optional<string>
To fetch the next page of records, include offset from the previous request in the next request's parameters.

view
optional<string>
The name or ID of a view in the table. If set, only the records in that view will be returned. The records will be sorted according to the order of the view unless the sort parameter is included, which overrides that order. Fields hidden in this view will be returned in the results. To only return a subset of fields, use the fields parameter.

sort
optional<array of the below object>
A list of sort objects that specifies how the records will be ordered. Each sort object must have a field key specifying the name of the field to sort on, and an optional direction key that is either "asc" or "desc". The default direction is "asc".

The sort parameter overrides the sorting of the view specified in the view parameter. If neither the sort nor the view parameter is included, the order of records is arbitrary.

field
string
direction
optional<"asc" | "desc">
filterByFormula
optional<string>
A formula used to filter records. The formula will be evaluated for each record, and if the result is not 0, false, "", NaN, [], or #Error! the record will be included in the response. We recommend testing your formula in the Formula field UI before using it in your API request.

If combined with the view parameter, only records in that view which satisfy the formula will be returned.

The formula must be encoded first before passing it as a value. You can use this tool to not only encode the formula but also create the entire url you need.

Formulas can use field names, or field id's inside of the formula.

Note Airtable's API only accepts request with a URL shorter than 16,000 characters. Encoded formulas may cause your requests to exceed this limit. To fix this issue you can instead make a POST request to /v0/{baseId}/{tableIdOrName}/listRecords while passing the parameters within the body of the request instead of the query parameters.

cellFormat
optional<"json" | "string">
The format that should be used for cell values. Supported values are:

json: cells will be formatted as JSON, depending on the field type.
string: cells will be formatted as user-facing strings, regardless of the field type.
The timeZone and userLocale parameters are required when using string as the cellFormat.

Note: You should not rely on the format of these strings, as it is subject to change.

The default is json.

fields
optional<array of strings>
Only data for fields whose names or IDs are in this list will be included in the result. If you don't need every field, you can use this parameter to reduce the amount of data transferred.

Note Airtable's API only accepts request with a URL shorter than 16,000 characters. Encoded formulas may cause your requests to exceed this limit. To fix this issue you can instead make a POST request to /v0/{baseId}/{tableIdOrName}/listRecords while passing the parameters within the body of the request instead of the query parameters.

returnFieldsByFieldId
optional<boolean>
An optional boolean value that lets you return field objects where the key is the field id.

This defaults to false, which returns field objects where the key is the field name.

recordMetadata
optional<array of "commentCount">
An optional field that, if specified, includes commentCount on each record returned.

Response format
List of records with fields and cell values

offset
optional<string>
If there are more records, the response will contain an offset. Pass this offset into the next request to fetch the next page of records.

records
array of the below object
A single record with field and cell values

id
string
Record ID

createdTime
string
A date timestamp in the ISO format, eg:"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"

fields
object
Cell values are keyed by either field name or field ID (conditioned on returnFieldsByFieldId).

See Cell Values for more information on cell value response types.

key: string	Cell value
commentCount
optional<number>
The number of comments (if there are any) on the record.

The recordMetadata query parameter must include "commentCount" in order to receive this.

Update record
patch
put
https://api.airtable.com/v0/{baseId}/{tableIdOrName}/{recordId}
Updates a single record. Table names and table ids can be used interchangeably. We recommend using table IDs so you don't need to modify your API request when your table name changes. A PATCH request will only update the fields you specify, leaving the rest as they were. A PUT request will perform a destructive update and clear all unspecified cell values.

Your request body should include a fields property whose value is an object containing your record's cell values, keyed by either field name or field id.

Automatic data conversion for update actions can be enabled via typecast parameter. The Airtable API will perform best-effort automatic data conversion from string values if the typecast parameter is passed in. Automatic conversion is disabled by default to ensure data integrity, but it may be helpful for integrating with 3rd party data sources.

Create records
post
https://api.airtable.com/v0/{baseId}/{tableIdOrName}
Creates multiple records. Note that table names and table ids can be used interchangeably. We recommend using table IDs so you don't need to modify your API request when your table name changes.

Your request body should include an array of up to 10 record objects. Each of these objects should have one key whose value is an inner object containing your record's cell values, keyed by either field name or field id.

Returns a unique array of the newly created record ids if the call succeeds.

You can also include a single record object at the top level.
